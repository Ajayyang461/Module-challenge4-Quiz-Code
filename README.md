## Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz
## Challenges

The Challenges in this module was to have a button that can generate quiz question in the DOM by using certain methods and elements to pass and call functions and setting timer limit within the quiz.

## Lessons Learned

Lesson I have learned is to create array of variable, for loops, and method and elements that can be called to the DOM. Overall this assignment was the most difficult for me in a sense when to declare a variable and createing new elements and appending it in to the DOM. I have tried using an object array, but had issue pulling into an for loop.
